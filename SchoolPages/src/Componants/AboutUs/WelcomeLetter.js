    const secondParagraph = <> <p>  Agial School is creatively designed to engage your
        child’s curiosity while encouraging a love of learning.
        Designed to be a secured, quiet and a healthy place for
        living a full day happily. The building incorporates the
        latest philosophy in building design and technology. All
        classrooms have been fitted with fresh air sources to reduce
        the transmission of disease. Our focus on health in the
        building extends to the flooring and furniture. Our PreK and
        Kindergarten building is designed with interactive spaces
        inside, as well as outside playing areas. This was an
        intentional design plan to encourage students to learn through
        play. This space provides an environment for young children to
        learn to take appropriate risks, practice cooperation, learn
        teamwork, and further develop their fine and gross motor
        skills, all done while playing in this purpose-built space.
        Our classrooms are well-equipped to satisfy the learners’
        needs and passion, and each classroom is equipped with a
        smartboard. We have a spacious library that has a reading
        corner designed to foster a love of books. Children are
        encouraged to spend time there each day. There are special
        rooms for cooking, and music that are designed to encourage
        young children to widen their interests and develop new
        talents.
