                  The Junior School classrooms are designed around a central
                  learning courtyard where pupils can engage, discover, and
                  collaborate. The concept revolves around all learning spaces
                  having physical and visual access to the outdoors. The aim is
                  to support and promote the sensory, cognitive, physical, and
                  emotional development of our pupils through innovative
                  learning techniques.
