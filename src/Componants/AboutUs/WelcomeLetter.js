                                    living a full day happily. The building incorporates the
                                    latest philosophy in building design and technology. All
                                    classrooms have been fitted with fresh air sources to reduce
                                    the transmission of disease. Our focus on health in the
                                    building extends to the flooring and furniture. Our PreK and
                                    Kindergarten building is designed with interactive spaces
                                    inside, as well as outside playing areas. This was an
                                    intentional design plan to encourage students to learn through
                                    play. This space provides an environment for young children to
                                    learn to take appropriate risks, practice cooperation, learn
                                    teamwork, and further develop their fine and gross motor
                                    skills, all done while playing in this purpose-built space.
                                    Our classrooms are well-equipped to satisfy the learners’
                                    needs and passion, and each classroom is equipped with a
                                    smartboard. We have a spacious library that has a reading
                                    corner designed to foster a love of books. Children are
                                    encouraged to spend time there each day. There are special
                                    rooms for cooking, and music that are designed to encourage
                                    young children to widen their interests and develop new
                                    talents.
